          <b>"The Greatest"</b>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Born on January 17, 1942, Muhammad Ali (formely known as Cassius
          Clay), was an American professional boxer and activist. Nicknamed
          <b>"The Greatest"</b>, he is widely regarded as one of the most
          significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century, and is
          frequently ranked as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ali was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, he began training as
          an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the light
          heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turned
          professional later that year. He became a Muslim after 1961. He won
          the world heavyweight championship from Sonny Liston in a major upset
          on February 25, 1964, at age 22. Also that year, he renounced his
          birth name as a "slave name" and formally changed his name to Muhammad
          Ali.
